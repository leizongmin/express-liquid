=================

      filters:  {},     // Optional, custom filters (reference tinyliquid)
      parallel: false   // Optional, parallel get data (reference tinyliquid)
    };
    app.set('view engine', 'liquid');
    app.engine('liquid', require('express-liquid')(options));

More about **Liquid**, see here: https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid

2.Setting layout (disable default)ï¼š

    app.locals.layout = true;           // enable layout, the layout name is "layout"
    app.locals.layout = 'other_layout'; // enable layout, the layout name is "other_layout"

3.Render template

    res.render('template_name', data);

4.About **include** tag: {% include %}
> The root directory is **views**, for example: {% include "abc/efg" %} will include the file "abc/edf" under the "views" directory

5.Usually, you may omit template file name suffix, then it will try to add a subffix name from the configuration `view engine`
